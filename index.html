							<br>Dependent clause: An incomplete though that cannot stand on its own, requires an independent clause to become a complete sentence.
							Ex:

							<br>Phrase: Collection of words that may have nouns or verbs, but it does not have a subject doing a verb.
							Ex: 
							1.	Everything that glitters isn’t gold.

				In my spare time I enjoy watching comedy movies, swiming and being a mom to my beautiful baby girl; which is a full time job within itself. I was born in Chicago and was raised in the South Suburbs of Chicago by my grandmother, who soon adopted me and became my mother while I was still very young. I grew up in an upcoming era of technology.
				I started with computers and grew from there. I became interested with tecnology at a young age. It started with computer games, then evolved into learning to type. These activities kept me ocupied during my free time. Soon I learned about the internet, This gave me a new perspective on the computer and the internet. I loved this feeling and I was hooked on computers ever since.
				Taking computer classes over the summer as well as classes in school increased my knowledge in technology. Ever since, I have been on the computer doing multiple projects, papers, games, etc. <br>
